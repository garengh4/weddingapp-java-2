******Project:****** weddingapp-java-2  

  
******Overview:******  
In this project, users are able to register, create, update and delete data from the database through valid API requests. By adhering strictly to object-oriented principles, all classes and objects are abstracted, encapsulated, polymorphed and inherited. This allows for good maintainable code that can be easily edited down the road if need be.

******Technologies Involved:******  
Springboot, Mockito, JPA persistence, H2bdatabase, Java 11 maven and MySQL

******Project statement:******  
This is a web-based store that allows for the renting of personal backyards to the general public. There will be 2 types of users: customers and partners. The customer will go through a list of available backyards and book an event there at a specific date, while the partner will put up postings for available backyards to the customers. Note that a singular partner can have multiple backyards and a singular customer can book multiple events at one or many backyards. Note hence that both types of clients will first need to create an account and login to map data.
