******Project:****** weddingapp-java-2  

  
******Overview:******  
In this project, users are able to register, create, update and delete data from the database through valid API requests. By adhering strictly to object-oriented principles, all classes and objects in this project shall be abstracted, encapsulated, polymorphed and inherited. This allow for both good maintainable code that can be edited down the road and also proper security so irrelevant data will not be leaked.

******Language Involved:******  
Java, SQL

******Technologies Involved:******  
Springboot, Mockito, JPA persistence, H2bdatabase, Java 11 Maven, MySQL

******Project statement:******  
This is the backend interface for a web-based store that allows for the renting of personal backyards to the general public. There will be 2 types of users: customers and partners. The customer will go through a list of available backyards and book an event there at a specific date, while the partner will put up postings for available backyards to the customers. Note that a singular partner can have multiple backyards and a singular customer can book multiple events at one or many backyards. Note hence that both types of clients will first need to create an account and login to map data.
